    <h1 id="top">Creating Links in HTML</h1>

    <p>A link or hyperlink is a connection from one web resource to another. 
        Links allow users to move seamlessly from one page to another, on any server anywhere in the world.
    </p>

    <p>A link has two ends, called anchors. 
        The link starts at the source anchor and points to the destination anchor, which may be any web resource, 
        for example, an image, an audio or video clip, a PDF file, an HTML document or an element within the document itself, and so on.

    <h3 id="mysql">My SQL</h3>

    <p>MySQL (/ˌmaɪˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/)[5] is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
        [5][6] Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter,[7]
        and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data 
        into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help
        structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational
        database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS 
        like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's storage system, manages
        users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of backups.

    </p>

    <p>MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under 
        a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by 
        Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation).[8] In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL 
        project to create MariaDB.[9]
    </p>

    <p>MySQL has stand-alone clients that allow users to interact directly with a MySQL database using SQL, but more often, 
        MySQL is used with other programs to implement applications that need relational database capability. MySQL is a component 
        of the LAMP web application software stack (and others), which is an acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python. 
        MySQL is used by many database-driven web applications, including Drupal, Joomla, phpBB, and WordPress. MySQL is also used 
        by many popular websites, including Facebook,[10][11] Flickr,[12] MediaWiki,[13] Twitter,[14] and YouTube.[15]

    <h3 id="or">Oracle</h3>

    <p>Oracle Database (commonly referred to as Oracle DBMS or simply as Oracle) is a multi-model[4] database management system produced and marketed by Oracle Corporation.

        It is a database commonly used for running online transaction processing (OLTP), data warehousing (DW) and mixed (OLTP & DW) 
        database workloads. Oracle Database is available by several service providers on-prem, on-cloud, or as hybrid cloud installation. 
        It may be run on third party servers as well as on Oracle hardware (Exadata on-prem, on Oracle Cloud or at Cloud at Customer
    </p>

    <p>Larry Ellison and his two friends and former co-workers, Bob Miner and Ed Oates, started a consultancy called Software Development 
        Laboratories (SDL) in 1977. SDL developed the original version of the Oracle software. The name Oracle comes from the code-name of a 
        CIA-funded project Ellison had worked on while formerly employed by Ampex.

    <h3 id="sqlserver">My SQL Server</h3>

    <p>MS SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. This product is built for the basic function of 
        storing retrieving data as required by other applications. It can be run either on the same computer or on another across a network. 
        This tutorial explains some basic and advanced concepts of SQL Server such as how to create and restore data, create login and backup, 
        assign permissions, etc. Each topic is explained using examples for easy understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is a software, developed by Microsoft, which is implemented from the specification of RDBMS.

        It is also an ORDBMS.
        
        It is platform dependent.
        
        It is both GUI and command based software.
        
        It supports SQL (SEQUEL) language which is an IBM product, non-procedural, common database and case insensitive language.

    <h3 id="m">Mongo DB</h3>
    <p>MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL).</p>

    <p>10gen software company began developing MongoDB in 2007 as a component of a planned platform as a service product. In 2009, the company shifted to an open-source development model, with the company offering commercial support and other services. In 2013, 10gen changed its name to MongoDB Inc.[
